1.	Inspired by many portfolio websites this project has as main focus the production of a single web page with css and html in order to show my future project to future co-workes and bosses my problem solving skills and the ability to see problem in a mullt dimensional way. I know that this project have room for improvement ass everything in life.

2.	In this project I have remembered not only the basics of front end but also all the skills needed to do integration using only the three languages that compose the front end Css javascript ans HTML, the ability to create boxes that not only exist in a scream but also have life and the ability to change what are they holding playing with data in a simple way but with great results.

3.	Icon creation was an important step in this project because of it I Was able to divide my ideas in an easy way.


ScrollReveal
ScrollReveal is a JavaScript library for easily animating elements as they enter/leave the viewport. It was designed to be robust and flexible, but hopefully you’ll be surprised below at how easy it is to pick up.
Installation provides us with the constructor function ScrollReveal(). Calling this function returns the Scroll Reveal instance, the “brain” behind the magic.
Scroll Reveal employs the singleton pattern; no matter how many times the constructor is called, it will always return the same instance. This means we can call it anywhere, worry-free.
There’s a lot we can do with this instance, but most of the time we’ll be using the reveal() method to create animation.
